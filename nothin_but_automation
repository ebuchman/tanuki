1,2,3into the 4 
drones, bots, AI and the futures at the door
ready for that entrace or should we back on up
cuz you know its bout to rip shit up
so fix the social structure first or itll burst like a bubble
blockchains and AI together, now you know you in trouble
aint nothing but automation baby,
no jobs left for people, theyll go crazy
facebook keeps the world in a daze ye
and googles got us all, cant escape it

but um, back to the lecture at hand,
perfecting machine intelligence is not a job for man
from a, security perspective
and before we solve AI we need to find our own directive
you never know it could be creature like man,
the teacher of man, and at the same time keeper of man,
you know I aint with that shit hasabis
aint no AI good enough to solve all the worlds problems
and thats realer than deep mind's acquisition deal
and now you tech companies know how I feel
if its good enough to beat the best, the end will come,
what you're building is what I want to protect us from
