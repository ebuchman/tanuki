1,2,3 into the 4 
drones, bots, AI and the futures at the door
ready for that entrace or we back on up
cuz you know its bout to rip shit up
so fix the social structure first or itll burst like a bubble
blockchains and AI together, now you know you in trouble
aint nothing but automation baby,
no jobs left for people, theyll go crazy
facebook keeps the world in a daze ye
and googles got us all, cant escape it

but uh, back to the lecture at hand,
perfecting machine intelligence is not a job for man
from a, security perspective
and before we solve AI we need to find our own directive
you never know it could be creature like man,
the teacher of man, and at the same time keeper of man,
you know I aint with that shit hasabis
aint no AI good enough to solve all the worlds problems
and thats realer than deep mind's acquisition deal
and now you tech companies know how I feel
if its good enough to beat the best, the end will come,
what you're building is what Im tryna protect us from

its like this and like that and like this and uh
its like that and like this and like that and uh
its like this and like that and like this and uh

tanuki creep to the mic liek a phantom

AI is creeping and its creeping and its peeping
with surveillance everywhere and facial recognition
so its time for us now to defend ourselves
cant sit back, relax, and give up our sovereign health
we've never been in a crisis like this before
with a people so dependent, unable to help their own
and they cant provide, with the 9 to 5, the clock ticks,
you know, and I know, that we just cant sustain this shit
so do some introspection, this financial system, just cant cope
its a joke, we wont float,
if you choose, to have no clue, then you'll get wiped out by what these robots are trained to do


its like this and like that and like this and uhm
its like that and like this and like that and uhm
its like this 
and who controls all the drones?
just chill, till the next episode

Moving on from the cash, with crypto-backed ledger goods
freeing people from their banks like a new age robin hood
its the capital that we need to invest locally
saving up to live without that debt, sustainable cities
showing much love when its time to provide
growing food and trading up, what we need to stay alive
yeh, and you dont quit,
I think we in the mood for some locally owned shit
so tanuki,
whatup dog?
gotta give em what they want
whats that Ki?
gotta build em out something
hell yeh
and its gotta be fault tolerant
tendermint blockchain

is what we put in place, local coins, a new system
universal income, wealth without restriction
bringin up the bottom rung to provide a higher baseline
a social net without the beurocratic waittime
try to centralize and you'll build a fragile stack
but crazy crypto, coins, and blockchains got your back
so never lose your wits, without wits, you're just drifting
when AI takes your income then you know you'll be thrifting
so I'm a continue to put the nets down, put my bets down,
that unless we fix this mess, AI will lead to frowns
yeh, and ya dont stop
i tell ya we'd all be better off if we can just get off the clock
but until then, look again, tell me what you see
AI on the lose and an unemployeed slew of theives,
so lets do this right together
with cryptocurrencies, I know we can all live better
