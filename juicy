Yeah, this song is dedicated to all the economists that told me
we'd never amount to nothin', to all the people that worked in financial
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the SEC on us
when we was just tryin' to free money from its corporate beholder
and all the devs in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?

it was all a dream
i used to read usenix with crypto feins
salts and nonces, math like you never seen
writing algos on the wall
every saturday, hack attack, is it magic or a flaw
I run my traceroute till I got no doubt
pwning punks and wifi, listening on private routes
way back, when i had the private key in my lap
and a hash to match
remember merkle proofs, duh-ha, duh-ha
you never thought that crypto would take it this far
now we're in the limelight cause the price is right
time to get paid, blow up, we're saving world trade
born sinner, the opposite of a winner
remember when it cost 10,000 for pizza dinner
peace to whit diffie, marty hellman, david chaum,
finney, merkle, szabo, you know satoshi's never gone
we're blowing up like we thought we would
hashin blocks, innovatin cuz we could,
its all good

and if you don't know, now you know, crypto

you know very well, who you are
don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars (or the moon)
you had a goal, but not that many
cuz you're the only one, the one and true money

we made the change from a common anarchist
to up close and personal with the banking rich
and we're far from cheap, hashing sigs with gpg all day
sign my key, its the crypto way,
no way, 
the crypto life keeps me busy
bankers used to diss me
now they running scared they might miss me
I never thought it could happen, this crypto stuff
I was to used to weapons exports stuff
Now bankers play me close like parasite play host,
From the bay area straight through the east coast
comapnies on the scene pumpin hypeware for weeks,
sold out seats to hear Peter Todd speak
Livin life without fear
putin 5 bitcoins in ma baby girls ear
lunches, brunches, interviews with mining pools
considered a fool cause we renounce the keynsian school
stereotypes of a crypto dev misunderstood
and its still all good

...

cryptocurrency, no counterparty risk
when e-gold went down man I couldn't picture this
50 peta hashes, money orange, open source-a
a few thousand nodes, and a big fat "i told ya"
banking bill about two G's flat
no need to worry now that bitcoin's got your back
and open source is lounging
celebrating every day, got everyone espousin
Thinking back on that sphaggetti code hack
Now we skirt capital controls leaving fiat in our tracks
And we love to show it off, of course
Reddit circle jerks everytime we up in Forbes
We used to fuss when the blocksize dissed us
Some feat, can't wait till lightning picks up
seg wit is the best shit
you can soft fork anything you wanted
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'cause we went from pennies to hundreds
and its all
