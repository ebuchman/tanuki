mista prime minister, where the fuck you at
cant handle dissent, yeh I know you get all mad
Your dick on hard, from fucking old laws
The party you threw up with, MPs you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why its time for some freedom to check your ass, figure,
Never were my homie, never were an ace
First past the post lying straight to our face
Try to make us bow down low
Fuckin me, now I'm fuckin you, PMO
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
let you hide your violent homicide
ya, its me so I'mma talk on
Harpers a villain that you cant muthafuckin count on
So strap on your Alberta hat, your skates,
and watch your back cause our country's at stake
Now, legalize the bud and stay low key,
MP, cause you lost all the people's love
So call it what you want to
You fucked with democracy, now its a must that it fucks with you,

Yeee, that's what the fuck I'm talking about
We have your mothafuckin' political party surrounded
Put down the trade deal and let the dirty pipelines go
You know what I'm saying, Punk motherfucker

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Human rights is in the motherfuckin house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Sound money in the motherfuckin house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
The sound of the free brings me to another day
Play, by the rules, would you stevie
It seems, like you're good for back stabbin while your grinnin
But here's some straight truth about the country that you might not like
We're proud to keep peace and play nice
But fuck the country, this is about your legacy
PMO, Steve-king-of-thieves
Your bark was loud and your effect was vicious
And them laws you been passing is hardly judicious
You get with freedom, be like, "oh is it crazy"
respectin people's lives, not snoopin on their baby
So won't they let it be said
That if you fuck with us, your fucking with the whole internet
And I ain't even slanging them thangs,
I'm hollerin 187 with my dick in your mouth, beyotch

Ye buddy, Left and Right together on this mother-fucker
So you wanna pass that shit, get your motherfucking party dissolved
Step on up, Now we aint no mother fuckin joke so remember the name
Mighty, mighty Democracy
Yea, motherfucker
