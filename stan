The dolla's gone cold I'm wonderin why,
I invest in banks at all
Bitcoin's knocking on my window
and blockchains solve it all
and even if I could just accept it for pay
with a QRcode on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad, its not so bad

Dear dollar, I wrote you but you still aint calling
I left my number, my address, and a QR code at the bottom
there were a couple of bubbles, hope you caught em, I know you popped em
Things got kinda crazy with Cyprus and China, or something
Sometimes I just crash upwards kinda sloppily when I got em
but anyways, fuck it, whats been up man hows the fallout
2008 was crazy, I might be able to solve it
If I have a derrivatives crisis, guess what I'm a call her
I'm a name her Bernaenke
I read about your Uncle Nixon too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over losing his gold standard
I know you probably don't hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I don't even mind that underground shit you did in Afganistan
I got a room full of your notes and your ancient coins man
I like that shit you did with Petro too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
Bitcoin 

Dear Dollar, you still ain't called or text, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up when you print so fast
If you didn't want to talk to me after the crisis
you didn't have to, but you coulda taken a hint from dr. mises
That's a great philosopher man, and he's pretty old
We've got all of Austrian economics, sound policy, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, he's like a fucking idol
He just wants you to succeed man
He might even like you more than I do
I aint that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when you were a promise, you said if I had you
you would give me some gold back, see I'm like you were in a way
I'm scarce and backed by security in the ether
But I don't have nothing tangible neither
See, I can relate to what your saying when you inflate
Its like right now, I'm being mined and sold away
Cuz all my coins aren't out so I make coins when there's a hashing success
I even record all my activity in a block chest.
Sometimes I even double spend just to see if I can fuck with fees
It's like adrenaline, hacking is such an integral part of me
See nothing you say is real, but I respect you cuz you tell it
Other coins are jealous cuz I talk about you 24/7
But they don't know you like I know you Green, no one does
They don't know what it was like for powerful currencies like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest friend you ever lose
Sincerely yours, Bitcoin, ps. we should share exchanges and infrastructure too.

chorus

Dear Mr. I'm too good to ask permission for my ledger
This will be the last time I ever send you a letter,
5 years, its absurd, you think you deserve it?
I know you're feeling the regulation, I wrote the bills to be perfect
So this is a cease and desist I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm rocking the press right now, 90 trillion in debt at this rate
Hey coin, I just took interest rates negative - dare me to thrive?  
You know that song by pink floyd on the dark side about money and life
About a style that could have saved us from corruption and beguile but didn't
And roger saw it all and had a hit he found it
Well that's kinda how this is, you could have rescued me from drowning
but now its too late, I've inflated a thousand bubbles now im drosy
and all I wanted was for you to just play ball
I hope you know I've ripped all your qr codes off the wall
I loved you coin, we coulda been together
think about it
you ruined it now
I hope you can't transact and you squeal about it
and when you hash I hope you overheat and can't cool without me
I hope your consensus fails you and you can't agree without me
see bitcoin - shut up bitch I'm trying to talk
Hey coin, that's the Euro screaming in the trunk but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up
see I ain't like you
cuz if she suffocates then Europe will collapse, and I might die too
well, gotta go, I'm almost at the financial cliff now,
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to bail my way out?



Dear Dollar, I meant to write you sooner I just been busy
You said Janet Yellen's pregnant now? How far along is she,
Look, I'm really flattered that you would fire Lawsky like that
And here's an autographed Satoshi, I wrote that on a borderless map
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the BRICS hq, musta missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but whats this shit you said about you like to print so much too?
I say that shit just clowning dogg,
c'mon, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Dollar, I think you need some counselling
help your ass from printing so much junk when you get down some
and whats this shout about inflating more housing bubbles
that type of shitll just keep getting you into more trouble
I really think you and your gold reserves need each other
or maybe you just need to treat them better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you implode on yourself, don't you think you've crossed a line
maybe relax a little, I'm glad I lit a fire under you but man,
why you so mad? try to understand, I do want to go hand in hand
I just don't want you to get away with so much crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some bankers were drunk and drove interest rates over a bridge and had faulty loans in the trunk
they're stealing money from little kids
and in the desk they found a tape, and knew exactly who it was to
come to think about it, the culprit was, it was you

Damn!
