## Lyrics

Y'all know me, still the same Tanuki. but I been low-key  
Workin on, whats all this? wicked cosmos things; so clear, that its king  
no fear, of bad kings  
more votes, more interchain staking  
Mad at me cause we can finally afford to provide ourselves with crypto financing.  
  
Got a chain with some simple rules and its all full of stake  
for that interchain securiteh  
feel that cross-chain love, with the cosmos hub, and the stargate breeze  
  
Did y'all think we wouldn't ship that new release? crypto please!  
You better bow down on both knees,   
who you think taught you bout BFT?  
Who you think brought you IBC,  
Dev & Sunny, Chris Goes, Marko, Bez and Zaki  
Jack Z-A-M-P  
And the group that said INTEROPERABLE SOVEREIGNTY  
  
Gave you a stack with a modular piece  
To assemble however you would  
And when your gas usage wasn't doing too good  
Who's the team that freed you from solidity?  
  
Y'all better listen up closely, all you tokens that said we werent cream of the crop,  
Or Cosmos flopped, y'all are the reason that Tanuki ain't been getting no sleep  
  
So build y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like it, fork for free!  
Or y'all can keep working on this with me and free the world from fiat tyranny  
  
Nowadays every token wanna talk like they got some usecase  
But nothing shows up,   
Tell you to buy the dip,  
That's just a bunch of gibberish  
And motherfuckers act like Cosmos isn't great  
  
So what do you say to someone building a chain?  
Or anyone tryna build something today?  
Wanna resolve things in a sovereign way?  
Start building with the Cosmos SDK  
  
One day I was walking by  
at a hackathon  
When I caught a guy  
Gave me an awkward eye  
So I just showed him how to rock the ABCI  
  
I don't give a fuck if it's Go or not,  
What's hardest for me is that EVM call  
when I'm flash loan jacked  
right next to a humongous stack   
of brand new yield farms  
  
Hopping out from getting rug-pull rekt, trying to shrug it off,  
Uniswap too?! shit call Tarun,  
I'm gonna mine you until this airdropped, heroin, rainfall stops  
  
And when it all came thru who was left but the chains of the IBC gang  
With a sovereign heart, each doing its part, you know the interop thang  
So from here on out, we sing a cosmos tune  
new highs today, ATOM 2.0 soon,
and we're still focused enough to ship a cosmos hub thatll take us to the moon  
  
Cosmos IBC, hotter than a fat DeFi treasury  
A gang of interchain frens with an airdrop cup  
when new chains stand up to cement our legacy,  
Cosmosmohamed Bitcoin Jaesustein, sorry Doc but we been crazy  
we decentralized the whole game, see?   
and you're not gonna make it, Samani
  
Nowadays every token wanna talk like they got some usecase  
But nothing shows up,   
Tell you to buy the dip,  
That's just a bunch of gibberish  
And motherfuckers act like Cosmos isn't great  
  
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop speculating  
With your alpha leak lookin to me, like you some VC
but you know all I care about is local currency  
now that we got some more company  
Everybody want IBC, to connect seamlessly  
cuz it's all about sovereignty  
celebrate in the hills of Medellin
  
I told 'em all, all them little blockchain  
Who you think helped mold 'em all  
Now you wanna run around talking bout fees like we ain't got none  
can't you think long term at all? we about to lift off  
now all I get is hate mail all day saying value captures off  
What cause we dont seek rent, and we build with intent  
whatevers most valuable  
  
  
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of ATOM stacks  
And theres a whole cosmos heading up to bat  
so give me one more tungsten plaque and drive off in a cadillac  
so where's all the hype developers at?  
its a new world in this aftermath  
so all you savage chads know its time to stack your racks  
and get validating cosmos apps
