## Lyrics
  
1,2,3 into the 4   
drones, bots, AI and the futures at the door  
ready for that entrace or we back on up  
cuz you know it's bout to rip it up  
so fix the social structure first or it'll burst like a bubble  
blockchains and AI together, now you know you in trouble  
ain't nothing but automation baby,  
no jobs left for people, they'll go crazy  
facebook keeps the world in a daze ye  
and google's got us all, can't escape it  
  
but uh, back to the lecture at hand,  
perfecting machine intelligence is not a job for man  
from a, security perspective  
and before we solve AI we need to find our own directive  
you never know it could be creature like man,  
the teacher of man, and at the same time keeper of man,  
you know I aint with that sh*t Hassabis  
ain't no AI good enough to solve all the world's problems  
and that's realer than DeepMind's acquisition deal  
and now you tech companies know how I feel  
if it's good enough to beat the best, the end will come,  
what you're building is what I'm tryna protect us from  
  
its like this and like that and like this and uh  
its like that and like this and like that and uh  
its like this and like that and like this and uh  
  
tanuki creep to the mic like a phantom  
  
AI is creeping and it's creeping and it's peeping  
with surveillance everywhere and facial recognition  
so it's time for us now to defend ourselves  
cant sit back, relax, and give up our sovereign health  
we've never been in a crisis like this before  
with a people so dependent, unable to help their own  
and they cant provide, on the 9 to 5, the clock ticks,  
you know, and I know, that we just cant sustain this bit  
so do some introspection, this financial system, just cant cope  
its a joke, we wont float,  
if you choose, to have no clue, then you'll get wiped out by what these robots are trained to do  
  
  
its like this and like that and like this and uhm  
its like that and like this and like that and uhm  
its like this   
and who controls all the drones?  
just chill, till the next episode  
  
Moving on from the cash, with crypto-backed ledger goods  
freeing people from their banks like a new age robin hood  
it's the capital that we need to invest locally  
saving up to live without that debt, sustainably  
showing much love when it's time to provide  
growing food and trading up, what we need to stay alive  
yeh, and you dont quit,  
I think we in the mood for some locally owned sh*t  
so Tanuki,  
whatup dog?  
gotta give em what they want  
whats that Ki?  
gotta build em out something  
hell yeh  
and its gotta be fault tolerant  
tendermint blockchain  
  
is what we put in place, local coins, a new system  
universal income, wealth without restriction  
bringin' up the bottom rung to provide a higher baseline  
a social net without the beurocratic wait time  
try to centralize and you'll build a fragile stack  
but crazy crypto coins and the blockchains got your back  
so never lose your wits, without wits, you're just drifting  
and when AI takes your income you'll be thrifting  
so I'm a continue to put the nets down, put my bets down,  
that unless we fix this mess, AI will lead to frowns  
yeh, and ya dont stop  
I tell ya that we'd all be better off if we can just get off the clock  
but until then, look again, tell me what you see  
AI on the lose and an unemployeed slew of theives,  
so lets do this right together  
with cryptocurrencies, I know we can all live better
