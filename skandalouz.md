## Lyrics

Hey Nate you know you got to focus on this motherfucker
We's gonna talk about these scandalous bros
I can talk about scandalous riches
Oh I know you can!
I know you that's why we gonna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, stop fucking around with the piano 
Just drop that shit like, this here

Thought you were a cosmos homie but you act like you're the one and only
So disappointed cause Do that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no loving from my closest homies
Would of paid you no mind, but Do your game got up and foaming

The chain proceeds with precision, but we got stable woes
Yeh I'm mad at you crazy, you went and played em Do
He chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without police permission

The mission's to be sustainable from the loss 
hyper finance is just a line you know we shouldnt cross
I don't want to see y'all in pain
but study up on hyman minsky, instabiliteh

It's scandalous, I never liked your stable back siengorage, trick
Tired of watching money grabing crypto chasing rich
Ready to bust, in the crypto you don't know who to trust
But riches looking scandalous

--

How's it hanging? Cause markets pullin back is not so banging 
I've been stressing in this crypto game, trying to do my thing
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissing
Don't want to see y'all gettin tricked into your cash missing 

You should be asking, who is qualified to analyze? 
you're looking at a space where everything is narratized
Every body, every motherfucker fantasize
We all hallucinate our fear through the scandalous eyes

This is the question of poverty
and the circus of the freak rich is something that bother me
Everybody sprung, addicted to the yield and the fun
but we know where this is going, it all comes undone
I've been trained in the biophysics, so what you saying?
Let me show you, got some theories we can all revisit

Before we let them get us off guard
gotta review the stable graveyard,
Crypto, why so scandalous?

--

Dangerous and ambitious, while scheming on getting riches
Comin up with new tricks, like we're addcited to fancy glitches
Currency motivated, too easily germinated
Now that we made it, responsibility can't be overstated

This is my prophecy, I don't gotta be paid
But we need to anchor into local networks of real trade
Finance ain't cool, we play the fool, thinking prices are true
While fuckin round like a punk crew

These are the tales of failed monetary schemes on the shelf
where people felt, they're building wealth
Busting along and preaching names in vain,
Gettin caught in the tricks, bags heavy in the game.

We all wanna ballers, but please
dont let the legacy of crypto be a worse banking.
Let's realign as a community, formulate some plans
for a more sustainable money. And let's not be scandalous


my sympathies to everyone whos caught up in this
take care of yourselves.
we still got a bright future ahead but we gotta look out for eachother,
we gotta learn from history, and we gotta think more about sustainability
we gotta stop chasin those crypto riches.
too fucking scandalous.

peace.
