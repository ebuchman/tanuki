If you want to go and use IBC
send an ack on back when you receive
Oh why's it engineered this way ? (Hey, its not for the money)

If you want to get the best BFT
Smoke out an L1, the app chain theses
Oh why's the interchain so great? (Hey, its not for the money)

:29
Interchain on a great ride, growing right
Look at me transact with a low gas price
Look I'm not gonna tell you how I think your chain should be number one
It could be 18 (18) ATOMs on the move
Or 90, thats perfectly respectable too
But as long you an ibc chain, yeh you know that its on (Know that it's on)

:47
I peep a new channel on the interchain
sexy and giga brain
saying it was time for a new kind of token game
Tanuki, plz explain? what is vitalik sayin
are people still clingin to the vision of a mainframe?

:57
I like the way your devs care
And I like the way you did your airdop fair
I like the way your governance split hairs
see maxis booing from way over there

Channels and a packet rack, deploy the whole stack
Without no vouchers on the chain you're bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, cosmos on track
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that

Whatch me pay my gas from a currency range
Watch the mintscan paint change, every time i switch chains
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain and all these chain daos

I got the wallet the mnemonic get the keys to be engraved now 
Damn shit done changed now
Running token bridges with no shame now 

I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
we changed the game now, every single chain a dao

packets out of channel 3, IBC,
telling me about some tokens being relayed in
And can I take em? Damn right. they be in the next height
minting cash, sending acks, slinging packets day or night


< chorus > 

2:40
Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted cosmos
who said that it was a failure
And now the same motherfuckers freaking out about Do
And I'm yelling: "I can't help ya"
"But Tanuki can we get tokens for the next float"
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

3:00
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
crypto want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good

We be them stud crypto, 'wishing you was' crypto
Popping like we token dealers, sipping liquid market making

Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends


So if sovereign want to knock, we knocking to this
And if sovereign want to rock, we rocking to this
And if sovereign want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Sovereign wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
Chain talk, Tanuki listen; Tanuki talk, Chain listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; crypto staring or they diss
Honies looking all "they wish" - come on boo, gimme kiss


3:00
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all "they wish" - come on boo, gimme kiss

Where they at?
If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
"So when Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: "I can't help ya"
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood

Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking

And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
