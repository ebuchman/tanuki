## Lyrics

the problem is there arent enough nodes she said to me  
the answer is easy if you just use btcd  
we're all here to help in the struggle to be free  
there must be, 50 ways to run a full node  

she said its really not my habit to contribute  
furthermore i hope my bandwidth wont be wasted or abused  
but i'll run one anyways at the risk of being a noob  
there must be, 50 ways to run a full node

just set up the stack, jack  
run the command, stan  
you dont need to be employed roy,  
to set yourself free  

hop on the bus, gus  
you dont need to trust much  
hash that merkle tree, lee  
and set yourself free  

she said why dont you just leave it running for tonight  
and i belive in the morning you'll be caught up with the current height  
and the she kissed me and I realized she probably was right  
there must be, 50 ways to run a full node
