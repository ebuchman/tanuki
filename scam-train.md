## Lyrics

I saw the reddit this morning  
I read the comments today  
About a man who took your money to build something  
And every day he gets a way another day  
  
I met a man from New York City  
He spoke of sigs, hashes and chains  
Seemed like a good man, driven by the freedom  
to fulfill satoshi's way
  
Its a scam train!  
  
I saw a coin launch this morning  
I caught the pump and dump today  
Did you see their web site, their white paper was alright  
crypto equity is great  
  
no it's really more like a scam train...
