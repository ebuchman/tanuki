## Lyrics

We've all seen the man at the coffee shop glancin at the charts
The vest on his chest betrays him, locked in still full of heart
He ask the man say think you would dare to get on chain
Dont give a dam, its all scam was his refrain

God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his bags
Then you really might know what its like to be down bad

Morty bought a coin from a kid who's anon, said he knew what to build
He said: "Don't worry about a thing, listen y'all, we're the crew thats gonna
get you your fill
But three months later he said see ya later when he dumped it all 
And Morty sweared, "Goddamn, If I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls!"

And then he heads to the market and he gets a panic placing an order 
They call his as broke, they call him a joke, they call him bag holder

God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his bags
Then you really might know what its like to have been had


I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry

I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie

I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up
And everything between

I took a shot at the moon, dodged a couple of rugs,
I trolled the old maxis

I caught the baddest dips 
Sniped a couple of bps 
before they blew me a apart

You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start


I knew this kid named Max, he used to like to stack sats with a proof of work
He liked to play it safe, he had his eye on fate, didnt want to get hurt
Until late one night they got the memes just right and Max lost his head
He aped in his whole life saved, got wrecked, just a sea of red 

Now his wife is pissed, cuz it looks like they missed generational gains
You know it comes that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game

God forbid everyone is getting rich except for you
Then you really might know what its like to have to lose
